# Facebook Login for Desktop Clients

Note: A Desktop is a system that doesn't have facebook's SDK support and is able to launch a web view, such as Java GUI, .NET GUI and so on.

You will obtain Facebook's OAuth2 code according to [Manually Build a Login Flow](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow) and send it to http://your-backend/token/new/social/by-auth-code/facebook/desktop .


# Steps
* [Create a facebook APP](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) if you haven't got one. 
* Add "https://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html" to the APP's "Valid OAuth redirect URIs". 
* Follow [the manual flow](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow), and check out our sample code.  
    * Make a simple button
    * See [facebookCodeLoginBtn.addActionListener()](https://github.com/chenjianjx/srb4j-desktop-client/blob/master/src/main/java/org/srb4j/desktopclient/view/MainForm.java). You will construct the facebook auth url, launch it with a web view inside your client application.  
    * See [WebEngineChangeListener.changed()](https://github.com/chenjianjx/srb4j-desktop-client/blob/master/src/main/java/org/srb4j/desktopclient/view/auth/SocialLoginBrowser.java). You will monitor the browser's URL until you get the auth code, and then send the code to srb4j's back end.
* [getEmailFromCode](https://github.com/chenjianjx/srb4jfullsample/blob/master/impl/src/main/java/com/github/chenjianjx/srb4jfullsample/impl/fo/auth/socialsite/FoFacebookAuthHelper.java) is the server-side code. You don't have to change it, but you will set "facebookClientId" and "facebookClientId" on app.properties.
